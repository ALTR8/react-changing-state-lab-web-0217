## Objectives

1. Practicing responding to state changes in React
2. Explain what happens when calling rendering a React component

## Overview

Continue to ramp up the challenge for students with this lab â€” we want to be
pushing the limits of what can be accomplished without breaking state out into
some kind of flux flow.
